When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath. andWhen my mind wanted to bring it back, sounded simple, en. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats sweating through t shirts in the middle of winter.

I take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually, it was ex. The instruction was simple enough. butI was missing something really important.

soWhy is it so hard to pay attention? wellStudies show that even when we are really trying to pay attention to something like maybe this talk, at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have this urge to check our Twitter fe?

soWhat's going on here? It turns out that we are fighting, one of the most evolutionary conserved learning processes currently known in science when that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man, this reward based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement and basically goes like this.

We see some food that looks good.

Our brain says calories surviv. We eat the food, we tasted it tastes good, andespecially with sugar, our body send a signal to our brain that says, remember what you are eating and where you found.

I we lay down this context dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. Sea food, eat food, feel good, repeat, trigger behaviour, reward. Simple, right?

wellAfter a while, our creative brains say, you know what you can use this for more than just remembering where food is. you knowNext time you feel bad. Why don't you try eating something good, so you'll feel better.

We think our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learned that if we eat Cho or ice cream when we are mad or sad, we feel better. Same process. Just a different t instead of this hunger signal coming from our stoma, this emotional signal feeling sad triggers editors to eat maybe in our teenage year, we were a nerd at school.

andWe see those rebel kids outside smoking.

We think, hey, I want to be cool, so we start s the Marlboro man wasn't a Doric and that was no accident. Sea, cool. Smoke to be cool. Feel good. Repeat trigger behaviour re.

andEach time we do this, we learn to repeat the process. andIt becomes a habit. So later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to surviv to literally killing ourselves with these habit, obesity and smoking uh among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.

soBack to my breath.

What if instead of fighting our brains are trying to force ourselves to pay at? We instead tapped into this natural reward based learning process but added a twist. What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience, i'll give you an ex in my lab we studied whether mind from this training could help people quit s now just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit s and the majority of them had tried this before and failed.

On average six, Tim.

Now with my phone's training, we dropped a bit about forcing and instead focused on being cu.

In fact, we even told them to smoke what yeah, we said go ahead and smoke. Just be really curious about what it is like when you do.

andWhat did they not? wellHere's an example from one of our smokers. She said mindful s smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals y now she knew that smoking was bad for her.

That's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoke was that smoking tastes like shit? Now she moved from knowledge to wisdom, she moved from knowing in her head that smoking is bad for her to knowing it in her bon.

andThe spell of smoking was broken, she started to become disenchanted with her b now, the prefrontal cortex that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary per it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.

andIt tries its hardest to help us change our b to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second that third that 4th cook.

We call this cognitive control we are using cognition to control our b unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.

Now we can all relate to this in our own experi. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be help, we just can't help our.

Now, when the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our whole habit, which is why this disenchantment is so important.

Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them in a deeper level to know it on a bone. So we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from b we're just less interested in doing it in the first place.

andThis is what mind fullness is all about. Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our b becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance naturally letting go.

This isn't to say that prove magically we quit smoking. But over time as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our action, we let go of old habits and form new on.

The paradox here is that my phone is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to mo.

This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly a possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by c which is naturally rewarding.

What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. andWhat happens when we get cu? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations.

ohThere's tightness, there's t there's restlessness and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite size pieces of experi that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this Hu scary craving that we choke on.

In other words, when we get cu, we step out of our old fear based reactive habit patterns. andWe step into being we become this inner scientists where we are eagerly awaiting that next data.

. Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect b but in one study, we found that mind fullness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit s so it actually work.

andWhen we studied the brains of experienced meditate as, we found that parts of a neural network of the self referential processing called the default mode network where it play play.

Now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior singular COR is activated not necessarily by craving it. But when we get caught up in it when, we get sucked in and it takes us for a ri.

In contrast, when we let go step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happen, the same brain region quiet down.

Now we're testing APP and online based mind fullness training program, target these core mechan and ironically use the same technology that's driving us to di to help us step out of our, unhealthy habit patterns of smoking of stress eating and other addictive b now remember that bit about context dependent memory, we can deliver these tool two people's fingertips in the context that matter most so we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware, right?

When that urges to smoke or stress it or whatever, Ari.

So if you don't smoke or stress it, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your EMAIL when you are bored or you are trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you are DR.

See if you can tap in this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that mo.

It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loop or step out of it.

Instead of see text message compulsively text back feel a little bit better. Notice the urge get curious, feel the joy of letting go. And repeat thank you.
